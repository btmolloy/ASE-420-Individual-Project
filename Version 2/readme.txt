This Python prototype offers a straightforward Time Management App. Using SQLite, it allows you to record tasks with details such as date, start time, end time, task name, and task tag. You can then search for tasks based on various criteria. The example usage at the end showcases a simple interface for recording time, searching tasks, and exiting the application. 

DatabaseConnectionFactory.py: This class implements a singleton pattern to manage the SQLite database connection, ensuring a single instance for the entire application.

TaskRecordValidator.py: This class provides static methods to validate date and time formats, ensuring input consistency in the TaskManager.

TaskRecord.py: Represents a TaskRecord object with attributes like date, start and end times, task name, and tag.

TaskRecordRepository.py: Manages interactions with the tasks table in the database, including creating the table, inserting records, and searching tasks based on different criteria.

TaskManager.py: Orchestrates the recording and searching of tasks, utilizing the other classes for database interaction, validation, and task representation.

main.py: The main class initializes the TaskManager and provides a simple command-line interface for users to record time, search tasks, or exit the application.
