Design Patterns:

Design Pattern 1:
Pattern: Singleton Pattern
Date: 12/7/23
File: DatabaseConnectionFactory.py
Lines: 6 - 11
A form of the Singleton Pattern is used in DatabaseConnectionFactory to ensure that only one instance of the database connection is created. The _instance variable helps maintain a single instance of the class.

Design Pattern 2:
Pattern: Factory Method Pattern
Date: 12/7/23
File: DatabaseConnectionFactory.py
Lines: 13 - 17
Although not explicitly a Factory Method Pattern, the DatabaseConnectionFactory acts similarly by providing a centralized way to create and manage instances of the database connection. It serves as a factory for obtaining database connections.

Design Pattern 3:
Pattern: Factory Method Pattern
Date: [Provide the current date]
File: TaskRecordRepositoryFactory.py
Lines: [Specify the relevant lines]
The TaskRecordRepositoryFactory class implements the Factory Method Pattern, providing a centralized method for creating instances of the TaskRecordRepository class.

Design Pattern 4:
Pattern: Strategy Pattern
Date: 12/7/23
File: TaskRecordValidator.py
Lines: 4 - 18
The TaskRecordValidator class follows a strategy-like approach by encapsulating the date and time validation strategies in separate methods (verify_date and verify_time). The strategies can be easily extended or replaced without modifying the client code.
